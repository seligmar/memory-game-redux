# Memory-Game-Redux

This app is a memory game in which the player clicks on the back of two cards, revealing two paintings, out of a board consisting of eight pairs of randomly selected paintings from a collection of 98 possible paintings in the data collection. The app uses React and Redux and is animated with CSS.
